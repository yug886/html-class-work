When it was determined by Dutch explorers that New Zealand was not attached to the South American continent, they changed its name from Staten Landt (South America) to Nova Zeelandia (New Zealand), after the Dutch province of Zeeland.[12].Wellington, New Zealand, is the southernmost national capital in the world at latitude 41.2Â° South. It also shares the honor of being the most remote capital with Canberra, Australia, over 1,243 miles (2000 km) away.[15]
